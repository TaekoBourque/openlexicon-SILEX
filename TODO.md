 - create fetchers for each datasets (code that will download locally the datasets if it is not already present)
 - add conversion code (tsv->rdata) within each database directory.

* in shiny apps. Create a system to provides links to the README for each dataset: there should be a lists of 3-uples, with dataset names, filename, url to README)

# Chronolex #

_Chronolex_ provides naming times, lexical decision times and progressive demasking scores on most monosyllabic monomorphemic French (about 1500 items).

Thirty-seven participants (psychology students from Blaise Pascal University in Clermont-Ferrand) were tested in the naming task, 35 additionnal participants in the lexical decision task and 33 additionnal participants (from the same pool) were tested in the progressive demasking task.

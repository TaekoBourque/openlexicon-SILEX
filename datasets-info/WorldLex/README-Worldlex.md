WorldLex provides word frequencies tables for 64 languages, estimated from web pages (Blog, Twitter and Newspapers).

The web pages corpora were assembled by Hans Christensen and are available at [HC-Copora](http://corpora.epizy.com/index.html). According to this web site:

> The corpora are collected from publicly available sources by a web crawler. The crawler checks for language, so as to mainly get texts consisting of the desired language.
> Once the raw corpus has been collected, it is parsed further, to remove duplicate entries and split into individual lines. Approximately 50% of each entry is then deleted. Since you cannot fully recreate any entries, the entries are anonymised and this is a non-profit venture I believe that it would fall under Fair Use.

The frequencies tables were created by [Manuel Gimenes](https://sites.google.com/site/manuelgimeneshomepage/) & [Boris New](http://psycho-usmb.fr/boris.new/)

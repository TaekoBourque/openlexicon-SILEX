This file is the Silex Master File. It contains the minimum information necessary to generate all Silex files. It is intended for experts who would like to further develop or customize Silex. For other purposes, use the other Silex files (see the User Guide for more details). Remember that if the file is too slow, you can customize it by deleting any unnecessary rows, columns, or worksheets.	

Variable Explanations:

OrthForm: The orthographic form of the word.

PhonForm: The phonological form of the word.

SyllForm: The syllabic form of the word, based on its phonological form (see PhonForm).

SyntClass: The syntactic class of the word. The codes for content words are: ADJ = adjective; ADV = adverb; NOM = common noun; and VER = verb. The codes for function words are: CON = conjunction; DET = determiner; PRE = preposition; and PRO = pronoun. In the Silex Master File, each word entry has one syntactic class given that homophonous homographs are distinguished (e.g., anglais ADJ and anglais NOM are different word entries). In the Silex Stimuli Selectors, however, homophonous homographs are considered as instances of one and the same word. Therefore, all possible syntactic classes for a given word are provided in the same column (e.g., anglais ADJ-NOM).

Gender: The gender of the word. The codes for word gender are: Masc = masculine (e.g., ami); Fem = feminine (e.g., amie); Both = masculine or feminine, without a change in the orthographic and phonological forms (e.g., enfant). Only adjectives, nouns, determiners, and pronouns have a code for word gender in Silex. The rest of the words have the code for missing data (-). In the Silex Stimuli Selectors (contrary to the Silex Master File), homophonous homographs (e.g., savoir noun and savoir verb) are considered as instances of one and the same word. Therefore, words that can have gender or not depending on their syntactic class are coded with the gender that they have when they are adjectives, nouns, determiners, or pronouns (e.g., savoir is coded Masc because it can be a masculine noun).

InfMorpho: The coding of the word for inflectional morphology. The codes are: UNI = uninflected form (e.g., joli); PLU = plural form (e.g., jolis); FEM = feminine (e.g., jolie); PLU+FEM = plural and feminine form (e.g., jolies); IVB = infinitive verbal form (e.g., parler); OVB = other verbal form (e.g., parlez). In the current version of Silex, all feminine nouns are treated as uninflected words (e.g., magie, because it has no masculine counterpart; amie, although it has a masculine counterpart), as well as all singular adjectives, determiners, and pronouns that do not change as a function of gender (e.g., ludique, chaque, moi). Adverbs, conjunctions, and prepositions are also uninflected words. Finally, past participles are all coded OVB, although they vary in number and gender (e.g., fini, finis, finie, finies). The variable InfMorpho was used to compute statistics for uninflected words only (UNI) and for inflected words only (not UNI), and these statistics were included in the different Silex workbooks.

FreqLex: Frequency of occurrence per million words in a corpus of 218 adult novels (Lexique 3.80: www.lexique.org). An empty cell in this column means that the word has no frequency in this corpus. The variable FreqLex was used to create the Silex Stimuli Selector for Lexique Novels. In the Silex Stimuli Selectors (contrary to the Silex Master File), homophonous homographs (e.g., anglais noun and anglais adjective) are considered as instances of one and the same word. Therefore, the frequency of homophonous homographs is the sum of the frequencies corresponding to their different syntactic classes (e.g., frequency of anglais = frequency of anglais noun + frequency of anglais adjective).

FreqManG15: Frequency of occurrence per million words in a corpus of 54 Grades 1–5 readers (Manulex-infra: www.manulex.org). An empty cell in this column means that the word has no frequency in this corpus. The variable FreqManG15 was used to create the Silex Stimuli Selector for Manulex Readers (Grades 1–5). Remember that Manulex-infra used the U index, which is the frequency per million words ajusted for the dispersion of the word in the corpus. In the Silex Stimuli Selectors (contrary to the Silex Master File), homophonous homographs (e.g., anglais noun and anglais adjective) are considered as instances of one and the same word. Therefore, the frequency of homophonous homographs is the sum of the frequencies corresponding to their different syntactic classes (e.g., frequency of anglais = frequency of anglais noun + frequency of anglais adjective).

FreqManG1: Frequency of occurrence per million words in a corpus of 13 Grade 1 readers (Manulex-infra: www.manulex.org). An empty cell in this column means that the word has no frequency in this corpus. The variable FreqManG1 was used to create the Silex Stimuli Selector for Manulex Readers (Grade 1). Remember that Manulex-infra used the U index, which is the frequency per million words ajusted for the dispersion of the word in the corpus. In the Silex Stimuli Selectors (contrary to the Silex Master File), homophonous homographs (e.g., anglais noun and anglais adjective) are considered as instances of one and the same word. Therefore, the frequency of homophonous homographs is the sum of the frequencies corresponding to their different syntactic classes (e.g., frequency of anglais = frequency of anglais noun + frequency of anglais adjective).

FreqManG2: Frequency of occurrence per million words in a corpus of 13 Grade 2 readers (Manulex-infra: www.manulex.org). An empty cell in this column means that the word has no frequency in this corpus. The variable FreqManG2 was used to create the Silex Stimuli Selector for Manulex Readers (Grade 2). Remember that Manulex-infra used the U index, which is the frequency per million words ajusted for the dispersion of the word in the corpus. In the Silex Stimuli Selectors (contrary to the Silex Master File), homophonous homographs (e.g., anglais noun and anglais adjective) are considered as instances of one and the same word. Therefore, the frequency of homophonous homographs is the sum of the frequencies corresponding to their different syntactic classes (e.g., frequency of anglais = frequency of anglais noun + frequency of anglais adjective).

FreqManG35: Frequency of occurrence per million words in a corpus of 28 Grades 3–5 readers (Manulex-infra: www.manulex.org). An empty cell in this column means that the word has no frequency in this corpus. The variable FreqManG35 was used to create the Silex Stimuli Selector for Manulex Readers (Grades 3–5). Remember that Manulex-infra used the U index, which is the frequency per million words ajusted for the dispersion of the word in the corpus. In the Silex Stimuli Selectors (contrary to the Silex Master File), homophonous homographs (e.g., anglais noun and anglais adjective) are considered as instances of one and the same word. Therefore, the frequency of homophonous homographs is the sum of the frequencies corresponding to their different syntactic classes (e.g., frequency of anglais = frequency of anglais noun + frequency of anglais adjective).

PhonSegm: The phonemic segmentation of the word. In this column, the phonological form of the word (see PhonForm) is segmented into phonemic units based on the spelling-oriented approach described in the User Guide (e.g., loi and loua both segmented .l.wa.; toi and toit both segmented .t.wa.). Segments are surrounded by dots to facilitate the use of Excel filters (e.g., selecting all words that contain .a., without the a in .wa.).

GraSegm: The graphemic segmentation of the word. In this column, the orthographic form of the word (see OrthForm) is segmented into graphemic units based on the spelling-oriented approach described in the User Guide (e.g., loi, loua, toi, and toit segmented .l.oi., .l.oua., .t.oi., and .t.oi.t., respectively). Segments are surrounded by dots to facilitate the use of Excel filters (e.g., selecting all words that contain .i., without the i in .oi.).

AllPhonMap: The phoneme-grapheme mapping of all phonemes in the word. In this column, each phoneme segmented (see PhonSegm) is mapped onto its corresponding grapheme (see GraSegm). For instance, loi and loua are coded .l-l.wa-oi. and .l-l.wa-oua., respectively. Given that silent-letter endings do not have any phonological value, they are not included in this mapping (e.g., toi and toit are both coded .t-t.wa-oi.). Silent-letter endings are provided in the OrthEnding column.

OrthEnding: The orthographic ending of the word. In this column, the silent-letter ending of the word is identified, if any (e.g., d, e, s, t, x, gt, and ent in froid, voie, fois, toit, choix, doigt, and soient, respectively). Words without silent-letter endings have a code for the null grapheme (e.g., # for loi). More details on our analysis of silent-letter endings can be found in the User Guide.

LastPhonLet: The last phonological letter in the word. A phonological letter is a non-silent letter that is either pronounced as a single-letter grapheme (e.g., u corresponding to /y/ in barbu) or as part of a multi-letter grapheme (e.g., u in the grapheme ou corresponding to /u/ in bijou). As such, the last phonological letter can occur at the end of the word (e.g., barbu, bijou) or before a silent-letter ending (e.g., début and debout, both with a silent t). The last phonological letter, then, is not necessarily the word's final letter (compare with FinLet). Among other things, this column can be used to select words where the silent-letter ending is preceded by a specific letter.

LastPhonMap: The word's last phoneme-grapheme mapping. This column is the reproduction of the last (or only) phoneme-grapheme mapping included in the AllPhonMap column. The mapping, and not only the grapheme, is provided, because the same graphemes can correspond to different phonemes (e.g., /ɑ̃/-en and /ɛ̃/-en in the words violent and revient, respectively, where the t is silent). Among other things, this column can be used to select words where the silent-letter ending is preceded by a specific grapheme corresponding to a specific phoneme.

LastPhon: The word's last phoneme, however it is spelled. This column is the reproduction of the last (or only) phoneme segmented in the PhonSegm column. All words ending with a given phoneme have the same code here (e.g., the code %, referring to /ɑ̃/, for the words bilan, violent, camp, and temps, although the phoneme /ɑ̃/ is spelled an, en, am, and em, respectively). Among other things, this column can be used to select words where the silent-letter ending is preceded by any grapheme corresponding to a specific phoneme.

LastRimeMap: The word's last phonological rime and the graphemes that correspond to its phonemes. This column can be used only for the words ending with /ʀ/ preceded by a vowel. In these words, the final rime differs from the final phoneme (e.g., /uʀ/ and /ʀ/ in lourd), contrary to words ending with a vowel (e.g., /y/ is the final rime and phoneme in début). As for words ending with /ʀ/ preceded by a consonant or with any consonant other than /ʀ/, they usually end with a silent e or with no silent letter at all (when considering uninflected words only). Therefore, in this column, words that do not end with /ʀ/ preceded by a vowel have the code for missing data (-). Among other things, this column can be used to select words where the silent-letter ending is preceded by the specific graphemes corresponding to the phonemes in a specific rime.

LastRime: The word's last phonological rime, however it is spelled. This column can be used only for the words ending with /ʀ/ preceded by a vowel (for explanations, see LastRimeMap). All words ending with a given phonological rime have the same code here (e.g., the code aR, referring to /aʀ/, for the words bavard and barre, although the rime /aʀ/ is spelled ar and arr, respectively). Among other things, this column can be used to select words where the silent-letter ending is preceded by any graphemes corresponding to the phonemes in a specific rime.

LastRimeType: The type of the word's last phonological rime. Five types are possible: oral vowel (OV; e.g., panda, début, roue, épais, prix, chaud); nasal vowel (NV; e.g., bilan, violent, dans, blond); /ʀ/ preceded by a vowel (VR; e.g., avenir, port, avare, ailleurs, lourd); /ʀ/ preceded by a consonant (CR; e.g., cadre, sabre, être); or any consonant other than /ʀ/ (OC; e.g., lac, canif, musique). Among other things, this column can be used to select words where the silent-letter ending is preceded by a vowel letter (OV words), by m or n marking nasality (NV words), or by r marking /ʀ/ (VR and CR words). Silent-letter endings are extremely rare in OC words (when considering uninflected words only).

FinLet: The word's final letter, based on its orthographic form (see OrthForm). The final letter letter can be silent (e.g., t in debout) or not (e.g., t in mazout). Thus, it can be different from the last phonological letter in the word (see LastPhonLet) and from the silent-letter ending (see OrthEnding). Words consisting of only one letter (i.e., a, à, and y) have the code for missing data (-).

PreFinLet: The letter that precedes the word's final letter (see FinLet). Words consisting of only one letter (i.e., a, à, and y) have the code for missing data (-).

FinLetRole: The role of the word's final letter (see FinLet). In this column, each final letter is coded as a silent letter (SL; e.g., t in debout) or as a phonological letter (PL; e.g., t in mazout). Letters that are part of multi-letter non-silent graphemes (e.g., n in bilan) are phonological letters.

AmbiguityType: The type of ambiguity in the graphemic segmentation of the word. The codes are: None = no ambiguity; E+C = the ambiguity of final units made of e followed by a consonant (e.g., et in ballet), where the consonant is considered as a silent letter by some researchers; C+E = the ambiguity of final units made of e preceded by a consonant other than r (e.g., ce in place), where e is considered as a silent letter by some researchers. In Silex, the default option is to treat E+C and C+E units as multi-letter graphemes without silent letters, because removing the final letter in these units usually results in impossible spellings (e.g., e and c alone are not possible spellings for /ɛ/ and /s/ at the end of words). The Silex workbooks derived from the Silex Master File were all created using the default option. Users of Silex who would like to compute statistics based on an alternative coding can use the variables AltOrthEnding, AltLastPhonLet, and AltLastPhonMap, which provide this alternative coding. For instance, the orthographic endings of ballet and place are both # (i.e., null graphemes) in the OrthEnding column, but t and e, respectively, in the AltOrthEnding column; their last phonological letters are t and e in the LastPhonLet column, but e and c in the AltLastPhonLet column; and their last phoneme-grapheme mappings are e-et and s-ce in the LastPhonMap column, but e-e and s-c in the AltLastPhonMap column.

AltOrthEnding: An alternative version of the variable OrthEnding, for words with an ambiguity in their graphemic segmentation (see AmbiguityType for explanations). Unambiguous words have the code for missing data (-).

AltLastPhonLet: An alternative version of the variable LastPhonLet, for words with an ambiguity in their graphemic segmentation (see AmbiguityType for explanations). Unambiguous words have the code for missing data (-).

AltLastPhonMap: An alternative version of the variable LastPhonMap, for words with an ambiguity in their graphemic segmentation (see AmbiguityType for explanations). Unambiguous words have the code for missing data (-).

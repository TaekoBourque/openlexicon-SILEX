SILEX contains thousands of frequency and probability distributions divided into three worksheets: Orthographic Endings, Phoneme-Grapheme, and Final Letters. It enables users to build frequency and probability tables by selecting specific phonological and orthographic units, as well as other options (corpus, morphology, context, etc.). In particular, it can be useful to linguists who want to describe the French orthography and to psycholinguists who want to design new studies or create pseudowords based on the statistical properties of French words. For other purposes, use the other Silex workbooks (see the User Guide for more details). Remember that if the workbook is too slow, you can customize it by deleting any unnecessary rows, columns, or worksheets.	

Variables & Explanations: 
	
Corpus: In all worksheets, first column, users can choose among five corpora varying in size (from approximately 10,000 to 100,000 words), genre (schoolbooks vs. novels), and targeted audiences (children vs. adults). The options available are: (1) Lexique, a corpus of 218 adult novels (Lexique 3.80: www.lexique.org); (2) ManG15, a corpus of 54 Grade 1 to 5 readers (Manulex-infra: www.manulex.org); (3) ManG1, a subcorpus of 13 Grade 1 readers; (4) ManG2, a subcorpus of 13 Grade 2 readers; (5) ManG35, a subcorpus of 28 Grade 3 to 5 readers. Importantly, while some lexical characteristics do not change across corpora (e.g., phonological form, number of letters), other lexical characteristics do, the most important being word frequency. In addition to word frequency, which has an effect on token-count statistics, the number and diversity of words included also change as a function of corpus, and this impacts both type- and token-count statistics.

InfMorpho: In all worksheets, second column, users can choose among three word sets defined by their relation to inflectional morphology. The options available are labeled All Words (for all words, inflected or not), Uninflected (for uninflected words only), and Inflected (for inflected words only). Inflected words include all plural and verbal forms. They also include feminine-inflected adjectives, determiners, and pronouns that vary according to gender (e.g., jolie, la, elle versus joli, le, lui). In the current version of Silex, however, all feminine nouns are treated as uninflected words, despite that some of them have masculine counterparts. Adjectives, determiners, and pronouns that do not change as a function of gender (e.g., ludique, chaque, moi), as well as adverbs, conjunctions, and prepositions are also treated as uninflected words. Importantly, all lexical characteristics, including word frequency, do not change across the three word sets available, but the number and diversity of words included do, which has an effect on both type- and token-count statistics.

FreqCount: In all worksheets, third column, users can choose between type and token counts. These options are labeled Type and Token. They are two ways for measuring the frequency of phonological and orthographic units in the calculation of statistical indices. Type counts refer to the number of occurrences of a given infralexical unit (e.g., letter, grapheme, phoneme) in a given decontextualized list of words (i.e., all words have the same weight in the list), while token counts refer to the number of occurrences of a given infralexical unit in a corpus of authentic texts (i.e., the weight of each word is determined by its frequency in this corpus). In all corpora included in Silex, token counts are based on frequency per million words, as estimated in Lexique 3.80 (www.lexique.org) and Manulex-infra (www.manulex.org).

Phoneme: In the Phoneme-Grapheme worksheet, fourth column, users can select the phoneme for which they want a statistical distribution of graphemes. For instance, if they select & (the code for /ɔ̃/), users will see that, when it is the last phoneme in the word, it can be spelled on or om (e.g., blond, with a silent d; prénom, with no silent-letter ending), with each spelling having a probability that varies as a function of corpus, morphological type of words, frequency count, and position in the word.

Position: In the Phoneme-Grapheme worksheet, fifth column, users have the option to choose between position-independent and position-dependent statistical indices. Position-independent indices take into account all possible spellings for a given phoneme, whatever its position in the word (e.g., /m/ spelled m in main, mm in pommier, etc.). The code for position-independent indices is Any. As for position-dependent indices, they only take into account the graphemes corresponding to a given phoneme in a given position (e.g., /m/ is perfectly consistent in initial position because it is always spelled m, contrary to medial and final positions). If position-dependent indices are selected, three options are available: initial, medial, and final phonemes (e.g., /m/ in main, pommier, and album, respectively). The codes for these positions are Initial, Medial, and Final, respectively.

WDNoSLE: In the Orthographic Endings worksheet, fourth column, users have to make an additional decision regarding the words included in the calculations. In Silex, statistics can be based on all words (ALL) for a given corpus and morphological type, including words without silent-letter endings (e.g., not only gris and début, but also ami and barbu). Statistics were also computed only with the subset (SUB) of words with silent-letter endings (e.g., only words like gris and début). In the SUB distributions, the sum of all silent-letter probabilities equals 1, contrary to the ALL distributions, where the null grapheme is included in the distributions.

TypeCont: In the Orthographic Endings worksheet, fifth column, users have the option to choose between unconditional and conditional indices. The code for unconditional indices is UN. If conditional indices are selected, six types of conditioning contexts are available: (1) LE = the last phonological letter in the word (e.g., u in barbu, bijou, dessus, and debout; s and t are silent); (2) G1 = the word's last phoneme-grapheme mapping (e.g., /ɑ̃/-an in bilan, /ɑ̃/-en violent, and /ɛ̃/-en in revient; the ts are silent); (3) P1 = the word's last phoneme, however it is spelled (e.g., /ɑ̃/ for the words bilan and violent, although the phoneme /ɑ̃/ is spelled an and en, respectively); (4) G2 = the word's last phonological rime and the graphemes that correspond to its phonemes, only for the rimes made of /ʀ/ preceded by a vowel (e.g., /œʀ/-eur in ailleurs; the s is silent); (5) P2 = the phonemes in the word's last phonological rime, however they are spelled, only for the rimes made of /ʀ/ preceded by a vowel (e.g., /œʀ/ in ailleurs and soeur, although the phonemes are spelled eur and oeur, respectively); and (6) TR = the type of the word's last phonological rime (e.g., oral vowel in debout, nasal vowel in violent, vowel preceded by /ʀ/ in lourd).

PhonEnd: In the Orthographic Endings worksheet, sixth column, users can continue to define the desired conditioning context by selecting the phonological ending of the word. First, there are no options available in PhonEnd (-) when the option UN or LE is selected in the TypeCont column. Second, if the option G1 or P1 is selected in TypeCont, users can chose among all possible final phonemes. Third, if the option is G2 or P2 in TypeCont, users can choose among all available final phonological rimes. See TypeCont for examples of final phonemes and rimes. Fourth, if the option is TR in TypeCont, users have 11 options: (1) OV = oral vowel (e.g., barbu, radis, debout); (2) NV = nasal vowel (e.g., bilan, violent, blond); (3) VR = /ʀ/ preceded by a vowel (e.g., caviar, bavard, ailleurs); (4) CR = /ʀ/ preceded by a consonant (e.g., cadre, sabre, titre); (5) OC = any consonant other than /ʀ/ (e.g., lac, musique, legs); (6) V = OV and NV words; and (7) R = VR and CR words; (8) C = R and OC words; (9) V+R = V and R words; (10) V+VR = V and VR words; and (11) CR+OC = CR and OC words.

OrthCont: In the Orthographic Endings worksheet, seventh column, users can continue to define the desired conditioning context by selecting specific orthographic contexts. First, there are no options available in OrthCont (-) when the option UN, P1, P2, or TR is selected in the TypeCont column. Second, if the option LE is selected in TypeCont, users can choose among all phonological letters available. Third, if the option is G1 in TypeCont, users can choose among the graphemes corresponding to the phoneme previously selected in PhonEnd. Fourth, if the option is G2 in TypeCont, users can choose among the graphemes corresponding to the phonemes in the final phonological rime previously selected in PhonEnd. See TypeCont for examples of specific orthographic contexts.

Condition: In the Final Letters worksheet, fourth column, users have the option to choose between conditional (Yes) and unconditional (No) statistics for final letters, however they are pronounced (e.g., the probability of a final t in words like debout and mazout). The conditioning context is the preceding letter, however it is pronounced (e.g., u in debout, mazout, début, brut). The preceding letter can be selected in the PreLet column.

PreLet: In the Final Letters worksheet, fifth column, users who are interested in conditional statistics for final letters can select the preceding letter in this column.

UnitFreqSL: In the Final Letters worksheet, second last column, UnitFreqSL provides an additional frequency relating to the final letter: It is the frequency of that letter as a silent letter, given all the options selected in the worksheet. As such, UnitFreqSL is the numerator in the calculation of the probabilities provided in the UnitProbSL column: UnitProbSL = UnitFreqSL ÷ UnitFreq.

UnitProbSL: In the Final Letters worksheet, last column, UnitProbSL provides an additional probability relating to the final letter: It is the probability for that letter to be silent, given all the options selected in the worksheet. As such, UnitProbSL = UnitFreqSL ÷ UnitFreq.

Unit: In all worksheets, the units of interest, for which probabilities and frequencies were computed, are in this column. In the Phoneme-Grapheme worksheet, the unit is a grapheme corresponding to a given phoneme (e.g., ou corresponding to the final /u/ in bijou and debout). In the Orthographic Endings worksheet, the unit is a silent-letter ending (e.g., t in debout) or the null grapheme (e.g., # in bijou). Finally, in the Final Letters worksheet, the unit is a final letter, silent or not (e.g., u and t in bijou and debout, respectively).

TotalFreq: In all worksheets, TotalFreq is the denominator in the calculation of the probabilities provided in the UnitProb column. The total frequency is that of all words included in the calculations, given all the options selected in the worksheet: UnitProb = UnitFreq ÷ TotalFreq.

UnitFreq: In all worksheets, UnitFreq is the frequency of the unit of interest (see Unit) given all the options selected in the worksheet. As such, it is the numerator in the calculation of the probabilities provided in the UnitProb column: UnitProb = UnitFreq ÷ TotalFreq.

UnitProb: In all worksheets, UnitProb is the probability of occurrence of the unit of interest (see Unit) given all the options selected in the worksheet. As such, UnitProb = UnitFreq ÷ TotalFreq. In the Phoneme-Grapeme and Orthographic Endings worksheets, the statistics provided in this column are also called consistency indices.

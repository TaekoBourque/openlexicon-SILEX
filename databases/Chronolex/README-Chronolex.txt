Chronolex
=========

[Chronolex](Chronolex.tsv) provides naming times, lexical decision times
and progressive demasking scores on most monosyllabic monomorphemic
French (about 1500 items).

Thirty-seven participants (psychology students from Blaise Pascal
University in Clermont-Ferrand) were tested in the naming task, 35
additionnal participants in the lexical decision task and 33 additionnal
participants (from the same pool) were tested in the progressive
demasking task.

New, B., Bonin, P., MÃ©ot, A., Augustinova, M., & Pallier, C. (2011).

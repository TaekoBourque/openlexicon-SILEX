This folder and its subfolders are part of the
[OpenLexicon](http://chrplr.github.io/openlexicon) and
[Lexique](http://www.lexique.org) projects.

Important note: As the source tables take a lot of disk space (\>100MB),
they are not included in github repository. To get them, you need to
download and unzip the file
[databases.zip](http://lexique.org/databases.zip)

If you want to contribute, adding or correcting some databases, please

This folder and its subfolders are part of the [OpenLexicon](http://chrplr.github.io/openlexicon) and [Lexique](http://www.lexique.org) projects.

Important note: As the source tables take up a lot of disk space (>100MB), they are not included in the [github repository](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon). To get them, you need to download and unzip the file [databases.zip](http://lexique.org/databases.zip) 

The `.tsv` and `.csv` files are plain text files that can be easily important in to R, MATLAB or Python. To open them with Excel, check out <https://rievent.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000029172-FAQ-How-do-I-open-a-tsv-file-in-Excel->

If you want to contribute, adding or correcting some databases, please contact `christophe@pallier.org` and `boris.new@gmail.com`

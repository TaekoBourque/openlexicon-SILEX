SUBLEX-us
=========

Improved frequency measures based on American English subtitles (51
million words in total).

There are two measures:

1.  The frequency per million words, called SUBTLEXWF (Subtitle
    frequency: word form frequency)
2.  The percentage of films in which a word occurs, called SUBTLEXCD
    (Subtitle frequency: contextual diversity; see Adelman, Brown, &
    Quesada (2006) for the qualities of this measure).

The percentage of variance accounted for by these measures is
significantly higher than the variance accounted for by Kucera &
Francis, and Celex.

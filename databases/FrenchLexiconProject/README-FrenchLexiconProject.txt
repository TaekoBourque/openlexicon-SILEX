This directory contains the raw lexical decision time data from the
French Lexicon Project and the R scripts to compute the by-item
averages:

-   Inputs:

    -   `results.utf8.csv` \# raw lexical decision data from chronolex
    -   `lexcfreq.csv` \# lexical statistics from Lexique355
    -   `process.words.R` and `process.pseudowords.R` \# R scripts to
        compute rt by items

-   Outputs: `FLP.words.csv` and `FLP.pseudowords.csv`

Intermediate `*.csv` files contains the raw data with an additional
column ('keep') signaling the items that are within the subject'
mean+-3stddev range.

On unix-like systems, the `Makefile` allows you to run the scripts by
just typing `make`

# SUBLEX-us

Improved frequency measures based on American English subtitles (51 million words in total). Two measures are provided 

  1.  The frequency per million words, called SUBTLEXWF (Subtitle frequency: word form frequency)
  2.  The percentage of films in which a word occurs, called SUBTLEXCD (Subtitle frequency: contextual diversity; see Adelman, Brown, & Quesada (2006) for the qualities of this measure).

The percentage of variance accounted for by these measures is significantly higher than the variance accounted for by Kucera & Francis, and Celex.

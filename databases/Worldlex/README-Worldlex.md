# Wordlex #


WorldLex provides Tables of Word Frequencies for 64 languages, estimated from web pages (Blog, Twitter and Newspapers).

These tables were created by [Manuel Gimenes](https://sites.google.com/site/manuelgimeneshomepage/) & [Boris New](http://psycho-usmb.fr/boris.new/)

**Website:** <http://worldlex.lexique.org>

The original corpora were assembled by [Hans Christensen](hc.corpus@gmail.com) and are available at [HC-Copora](http://corpora.epizy.com/index.html). From this web site:

> The corpora are collected from publicly available sources by a web crawler. The crawler checks for language, so as to mainly get texts consisting of the desired language.
> Once the raw corpus has been collected, it is parsed further, to remove duplicate entries and split into individual lines. Approximately 50% of each entry is then deleted. Since you cannot fully recreate any entries, the entries are anonymised and this is a non-profit venture I believe that it would fall under Fair Use.

SUBLEX-us
=========

SubtlexUS is database containing word frequencies based on English-US
movies and TV series subtitles (51 million words in total). Two measures
are provided

1.  The frequency per million words, called SUBTLEXWF (Subtitle
    frequency: word form frequency)
2.  The percentage of films in which a word occurs, called SUBTLEXCD
    (Subtitle frequency: contextual diversity; see Adelman, Brown, &
    Quesada (2006) for the qualities of this measure).

# SUBLEX-us #

SubtlexUS is database containing word frequencies based on English and American movies and TV series subtitles (51 million words in total). Two measures are provided:

  1.  The frequency per million words, called SUBTLEXWF (Subtitle frequency: word form frequency)
  2.  The percentage of films in which a word occurs, called SUBTLEXCD (Subtitle frequency: contextual diversity; see Adelman, Brown, & Quesada (2006) for the qualities of this measure).

# OpenLexicon: Access to lexical databases

_[Openlexicon](https://chrplr.github.io/openlexicon)_ provides tables from various lexical databases and some code to manipulate them, either offline or online.

* Check out our list of [open lexical databases](databases/README.md)
* Query most databases online at <http://www.lexique.org:81/openlexique>
* Use [scripts](scripts/README.md) to query or manipulate the databases.

**For maintainers:**

- [How to add a new database](README-how-to-install-a-new-database.md)
- [Installation](README-Install.md)

**Data Tables:** 

The source tables from most databases can be downloaded from <http://lexique.org/databases.zip> (They take up too much disk space (>100MB) to be included in [Openlexicon's github repository](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon)).

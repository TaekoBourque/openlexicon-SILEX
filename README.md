# OpenLexicon: Easy access to lexical databases


**_[Openlexicon](https://chrplr.github.io/openlexicon)_ provides tables from various lexical databases and some code to manipulate them either offline or online.**

1. Check out our list of [open lexical databases](databases/README.md)
2. Use [scripts](scripts/README.md) to query or manipulate the databases.
3. Browse and query most databases online at <http://www.lexique.org/shiny/openlexique>

**Contributing:**

If you want to contribute, by adding a database, scripts, or sending some corrections, please contact `christophe@pallier.org` and `boris.new@gmail.com`, or, _much better_, fork [openlexicon](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon) and issue a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

**Data tables:** 

The source tables from most databases can be downloaded from <http://lexique.org/databases.zip> (They take up too much disk space (>100MB) to be included in [Openlexicon's github repository](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon)).

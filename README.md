title: OpenLexicon: Easy access to lexical databases
author: christophe@pallier.org
---

At OpenLexicon, you will find:

1. a [directory of lexical databases](databases-docs/README.md)
2. [scripts](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/tree/master/scripts) to query, manipulate or create lexical databases.
3. [apps](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/tree/master/apps/) to create dynamic graphical interfaces to the lexical databases. 
4. [documents](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/tree/master/documents/) of interest related to the processing of lexical resources. 


Some of the apps provide the infrastructure of <http://www.lexique.org>
where many of lexical databases are hosted and can be queried on-line --- check
out, for example, <http://www.lexique.org/shiny/openlexique>.

### Contributing ###

Everybody is warmly encouraged to contribute, by adding a database, an app, or a script.
First, check out Lexique's google-group at <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lexiqueorg>.  You can then contact `christophe@pallier.org` and
`boris.new@gmail.com` privately, or, _much better_, fork

request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

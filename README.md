# OpenLexicon: Easy access to lexical databases


At OpenLexicon, you will find:

1. a [directory of lexical databases](datasets-info/README.md)
2. [scripts](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/tree/master/scripts) to query, manipulate or create lexical databases.
3. [apps](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/tree/master/apps/) to create dynamic graphical interfaces to the lexical databases. 
4. [documents](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/tree/master/documents/) of interest related to the processing of lexical resources. 


* To automatically download datasets, you can use [fetch_datasets.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrplr/openlexicon/master/datasets-info/fetch_datasets.R)
* To add a new dataset, create a `.json` file in datasets-info (see [Howto](datasets-info/README-how-to-install-a-new-database.md)
* Some of the apps provide the infrastructure of <http://www.lexique.org> where many of lexical databases are hosted and can be queried on-line --- check
out, for example, <http://www.lexique.org/shiny/openlexicon>.


### Contributing ###

Everybody is warmly encouraged to contribute, by adding a database, an app, or a script.
First, check out Lexique's google-group at <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lexiqueorg>.  You can then contact `christophe@pallier.org` and
`boris.new@gmail.com` privately, or, _much better_, fork
[openlexicon](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon) and issue a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).


### Crediting ###

Most databases have associated publications listed in their respective `README`
files. They must be cited in any derivative work! The same goes for some of the
scripts (read their documentation for instructions).

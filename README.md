You will find here:

1. A [directory of lexical databases](datasets-info/README.md)
2. [Scripts](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/tree/master/scripts) to download and query lexical databases.
3. [Apps](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/tree/master/apps/) to create dynamic graphical interfaces to the lexical databases. Some of these apps are running at <http://www.lexique.org>
4. [Documents](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/tree/master/documents/) of related to the processing of lexical resources.

Most databases have associated publications listed in their respective `README` files. They must be cited in any derivative work! The same goes for some of the scripts (read their documentation for instructions).


### Contributing ###

Everybody is warmly encouraged to contribute, by adding new databases (To add a new dataset, you must create a `.json` file in `datasets-info/_json`. Check out [How-to-install-a-new-dataset](datasets-info/README-how-to-install-a-new-database.md)), an app, or a script.

First, check out Lexique's google-group at <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lexiqueorg>.  You can then contact `christophe@pallier.org` and `boris.new@gmail.com` privately, or, _much better_, fork the 
[openlexicon](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon) repository (see [How to fork a repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)) and issue a pull request (see [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)).

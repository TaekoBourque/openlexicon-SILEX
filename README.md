# OpenLexicon: Easy access to lexical databases

Here, you will find a list of [open lexical databases](databases-docs/README.md), and
some [apps](apps/) and [scripts](scripts/README.md) to query or manipulate them.

This repository provides the infrastructure of the site <http://www.lexique.org>
where many of these databases are hosted and can be queried on-line (check
out <http://www.lexique.org/shiny/openlexique>)

This document is at <http://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon> but can be
read in a nicer format at <https://chrplr.github.io/openlexicon>.

**Contributing:**

If you want to contribute, by adding a database, an app, a script, or sending
some corrections, please contact `christophe@pallier.org` and
`boris.new@gmail.com`, or, _much better_, fork
[openlexicon](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon) and issue a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

**Crediting:**

Most databases have associated publications listed in their respective `README`
files. They must be cited in any derivative work! The same goes for some of the
scripts (read their documentation for instructions).

**Data tables:** 

The source tables from most databases can be downloaded from
<http://lexique.org/databases>. (They take up way too much disk space to
be included in a github repository)

# OpenLexicon: Access to lexical databases

% Time-stamp: <2019-03-31 11:37:06 christophe@pallier.org>

_Openlexicon_ provides tables from various lexical databases and some code to manipulate them.

* List of the [currently available databases](databases/README.md)
* To query the databases online, go to <http://www.lexique.org:81/openlexique>
* To manipulate the databases, see  [examples of scripts](scripts/README.md)


**Important note**: If you want to get all the tables of the databases, you can download and unzip [databases.zip](http://lexique.org/databases.zip) (The tables are not saved in the [github repository](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon) as they take up too mush disk space)

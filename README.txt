OpenLexicon: Access to lexical databases
========================================

\% Time-stamp: \<2019-03-31 13:15:43 christophe\@pallier.org\>

*Openlexicon* provides tables from various lexical databases and some
code to manipulate them.

-   Check out the [currently available databases](databases/README.md)
-   Query the databases online at
    <http://www.lexique.org:81/openlexique>
-   Manipulate the databases offline, following [examples of
    scripts](scripts/README.md)

**Data Tables:** The tables from all the databases can be downloaded
from <http://lexique.org/databases.zip> (They take up too much disk
space (\>100MB) to be included in [Openlexicon's github
repository](https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon)).
